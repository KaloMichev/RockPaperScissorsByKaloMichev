# Rock Paper Scissors
My first REAL app/game written in C#

When you start playing you need to enter one of the following options:
- `r`, which stands for **rock**
- `p`, which stands for **paper**
- `s`, which stands for **scissors**

If you submit an imput that doesn't match these options you will be met with an **error**![Screenshot 2023-04-14 231122](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130793627/232145783-aeeddf4b-8940-4a1f-80a2-d808e9760cc4.png)
